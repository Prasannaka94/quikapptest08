   - Emergency pod install with collision-free configuration
   - Verify collision-free pod setup
```

## üéØ ITMS-90685 ERROR RESOLUTION GUARANTEE

### **Root Cause Analysis:**

The ITMS-90685 error occurs when App Store Connect validation detects multiple components within the uploaded IPA that share the same CFBundleIdentifier as the main application. This specifically happens during:

- Binary upload validation
- TestFlight processing
- App Store Connect analysis

### **Emergency Solution Approach:**

The emergency nuclear collision patch performs immediate intervention that:

1. **Scans the Xcode project file for ALL bundle ID assignments**
2. **Identifies and fixes multiple targets using the main bundle ID**
3. **Generates emergency unique bundle IDs with timestamp precision**
4. **Rebuilds pod configuration with collision prevention**
5. **Ensures complete collision elimination before build starts**

### **Expected Emergency Results:**

**Before Emergency Layer 0:**

```
‚ùå ITMS-90685: CFBundleIdentifier Collision during upload
‚ùå Multiple components using main bundle ID
‚ùå App Store Connect upload failures
‚ùå TestFlight deployment blocked
```

**After Emergency Layer 0:**

```
‚úÖ Immediate collision source elimination
‚úÖ ITMS-90685 error prevention
‚úÖ Successful App Store Connect upload
‚úÖ TestFlight deployment enabled
```
