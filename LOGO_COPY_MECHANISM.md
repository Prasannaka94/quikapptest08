# Logo Copy Mechanism - Branding Assets to App Icons

## 🎯 Overview

Ensures that the logo downloaded by `branding_assets.sh` is **reliably copied** to the path expected by Flutter Launcher Icons for iOS app icon generation.

## 📋 Flow Diagram

```
Stage 4: branding_assets.sh
    ↓ Downloads LOGO_URL → assets/images/logo.png
    ↓ Verifies download success
    ↓ Logs file properties

Stage 4.5: generate_launcher_icons.sh
    ↓ Step 1: Validates assets/images/logo.png exists
    ↓ Step 1.5: Copies to assets/icons/app_icon.png ← NEW ENHANCED STEP
    ↓ Step 2: Continues with icon generation
```

## 🔧 Enhanced Copy Mechanism

### Stage 4: Branding Assets (Enhanced Logging)

**File**: `lib/scripts/ios/branding_assets.sh`

```bash
# Step 3: Download logo
log_info "📥 Downloading logo from $LOGO_URL"
log_info "📍 Target location: assets/images/logo.png (for Stage 4.5 app icon generation)"
download_asset_with_fallbacks "$LOGO_URL" "assets/images/logo.png" "logo"

# Verify logo was downloaded successfully
if [ -f "assets/images/logo.png" ]; then
    log_success "✅ Logo downloaded successfully to: assets/images/logo.png"
    if command -v file &> /dev/null; then
        local logo_info=$(file "assets/images/logo.png")
        log_info "📋 Downloaded logo properties: $logo_info"
    fi
else
    log_error "❌ Logo download failed - file not found at assets/images/logo.png"
fi
```

### Stage 4.5: Logo Copy (New Dedicated Function)

**File**: `lib/scripts/ios/generate_launcher_icons.sh`

```bash
# Function to copy logo from branding_assets to flutter_launcher_icons expected path
copy_logo_to_app_icon() {
    log_info "📋 Ensuring logo is available at expected path for flutter_launcher_icons..."

    local source_logo="assets/images/logo.png"
    local target_icon="assets/icons/app_icon.png"

    # Ensure target directory exists
    ensure_directory "assets/icons"

    # Check if source logo exists (from branding_assets.sh)
    if [ ! -f "$source_logo" ]; then
        log_error "❌ Source logo not found: $source_logo"
        log_error "❌ Expected logo to be downloaded by branding_assets.sh in Stage 4"
        return 1
    fi

    # Always copy the logo to ensure we have the latest version from branding_assets.sh
    log_info "📸 Copying logo from branding_assets.sh to flutter_launcher_icons path..."
    log_info "   Source: $source_logo"
    log_info "   Target: $target_icon"

    if cp "$source_logo" "$target_icon"; then
        log_success "✅ Logo successfully copied to: $target_icon"

        # Verify the copy
        if [ -f "$target_icon" ]; then
            local source_size=$(stat -f%z "$source_logo" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$source_logo" 2>/dev/null)
            local target_size=$(stat -f%z "$target_icon" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$target_icon" 2>/dev/null)

            if [ "$source_size" = "$target_size" ]; then
                log_success "✅ Copy verified - file sizes match ($source_size bytes)"
            else
                log_warn "⚠️ File sizes don't match - Source: $source_size, Target: $target_size"
            fi

            # Show file properties
            if command -v file &> /dev/null; then
                local target_info=$(file "$target_icon")
                log_info "📋 Copied app_icon.png properties: $target_info"
            fi
        else
            log_error "❌ Copy verification failed - target file not found"
            return 1
        fi
    else
        log_error "❌ Failed to copy logo from $source_logo to $target_icon"
        return 1
    fi

    return 0
}
```

## 🚀 Expected Build Logs

```

### Stage 4.5: Logo Copy Success

```
--- Stage 4.5: Generating Flutter Launcher Icons ---
🎨 Using logo from assets/images/logo.png (created by branding_assets.sh)

📋 Ensuring logo is available at expected path for flutter_launcher_icons...
📸 Copying logo from branding_assets.sh to flutter_launcher_icons path...
   Source: assets/images/logo.png
   Target: assets/icons/app_icon.png
✅ Logo successfully copied to: assets/icons/app_icon.png
✅ Copy verified - file sizes match (15234 bytes)
📋 Copied app_icon.png properties: assets/icons/app_icon.png: PNG image data, 180 x 133, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. Always Copy Strategy

- **Always copies** the logo, even if target exists
- **Ensures latest version** from branding_assets.sh is used
- **Overwrites old versions** to prevent stale icon issues

### 2. Comprehensive Verification

- **File existence check** for both source and target
- **File size comparison** to verify successful copy
- **File properties logging** for debugging
- **Error handling** with descriptive messages

### 3. Path Management

- **Creates target directory** if it doesn't exist
- **Uses consistent paths** throughout the workflow
- **Clear source/target identification** in logs

### 4. Error Prevention

- **Validates source exists** before attempting copy
- **Fails fast** if logo not found from branding_assets.sh
- **Detailed error messages** for troubleshooting

## 📊 Integration Points

### Environment Variables Required:

```bash
# For branding_assets.sh (Stage 4):
LOGO_URL="https://your-domain.com/logo.png"

# No additional variables needed for copy mechanism
# Everything is handled automatically
```

### File Paths:

- **Source**: `assets/images/logo.png` (from branding_assets.sh)
- **Target**: `assets/icons/app_icon.png` (for flutter_launcher_icons)
- **Config**: `pubspec.yaml` image_path points to target

### Workflow Integration:

1. **Stage 4**: `branding_assets.sh` downloads → `assets/images/logo.png`
2. **Stage 4.5**: `copy_logo_to_app_icon()` copies → `assets/icons/app_icon.png`
3. **Stage 4.5**: `flutter_launcher_icons` generates iOS icons from target

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Copy Fails:

```bash
❌ Source logo not found: assets/images/logo.png
❌ Expected logo to be downloaded by branding_assets.sh in Stage 4
```

**Solution**: Check branding_assets.sh Stage 4 logs for download issues

### If File Sizes Don't Match:

```bash
⚠️ File sizes don't match - Source: 15234, Target: 12345
```

**Solution**: Indicates copy corruption - script will continue but should be investigated

### If Directory Creation Fails:

```bash
❌ Failed to copy logo from assets/images/logo.png to assets/icons/app_icon.png
```

**Solution**: Check filesystem permissions and available disk space

## ✅ Success Indicators

Look for these success messages in build logs:

- ✅ `Logo downloaded successfully to: assets/images/logo.png`
- ✅ `Logo successfully copied to: assets/icons/app_icon.png`
- ✅ `Copy verified - file sizes match (XXXX bytes)`
- ✅ `Copied app_icon.png properties: [file info]`

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Always ensures logo is available for flutter_launcher_icons
2. **Verification**: Confirms successful copy with file size validation
3. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. **Consistency**: Standardized path handling throughout workflow
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and fail-fast behavior

## 📋 Files Modified
