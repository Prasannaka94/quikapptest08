# Branding Assets → App Icons Workflow Integration

## 🎯 Perfect Workflow Order

The iOS build workflow now has **optimal integration** between branding asset setup and app icon generation:

```
Stage 4: Branding Assets Setup (branding_assets.sh)
    ↓ Downloads/creates logo at assets/images/logo.png
    ↓ Updates Bundle ID and App Name
    ↓ Sets up asset directory structure

Stage 4.5: Generate Flutter Launcher Icons (generate_launcher_icons.sh)
    ↓ Uses logo from assets/images/logo.png
    ↓ Generates all iOS icon sizes
    ↓ Removes transparency for App Store compliance
    ↓ Creates validation report
```

## 📋 What Each Script Does

### Stage 4: `branding_assets.sh`

```bash
# Downloads/creates assets
✅ Downloads logo from LOGO_URL → assets/images/logo.png
✅ Downloads splash from SPLASH_URL → assets/images/splash.png
✅ Updates Bundle ID in iOS project files
✅ Updates App Name in Info.plist
✅ Updates version in pubspec.yaml
✅ Creates fallback assets if downloads fail
```

### Stage 4.5: `generate_launcher_icons.sh`

```bash
# Generates app icons from logo
✅ Uses assets/images/logo.png (from branding_assets.sh)
✅ Generates all 21+ iOS icon sizes
✅ Removes alpha channels (fixes App Store validation)
✅ Creates App Store compliant icons
✅ Validates all generated icons
✅ Creates validation summary report
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Environment Variables Flow

```bash
# branding_assets.sh uses:
LOGO_URL="https://example.com/logo.png"
SPLASH_URL="https://example.com/splash.png"
BUNDLE_ID="com.yourcompany.yourapp"
APP_NAME="Your App Name"
VERSION_NAME="1.0.6"
VERSION_CODE="6"

# ↓ Creates: assets/images/logo.png

# generate_launcher_icons.sh uses:
# ✅ assets/images/logo.png (from branding_assets.sh)
# ✅ pubspec.yaml flutter_launcher_icons config
```

### File Flow

```
branding_assets.sh
├── Downloads: LOGO_URL → assets/images/logo.png
├── Creates: Directory structure
└── Updates: Bundle ID, App Name, Version

generate_launcher_icons.sh
├── Reads: assets/images/logo.png
├── Generates: 21+ iOS icon sizes in AppIcon.appiconset/
├── Removes: Alpha channels from all icons
└── Creates: Validation report
```

## 🚀 Workflow Execution Logs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Integration

### If Logo Not Found:

```bash

⚠️ Expected logo to be created by branding_assets.sh in Stage 4
Creating a default logo as fallback...
```

### If Logo Found (Success):

```bash
✅ Found logo from branding_assets.sh: assets/images/logo.png
🎯 Using logo downloaded/created by branding_assets.sh in Stage 4
```
